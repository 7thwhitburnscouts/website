# Sections

There are 450,000 young people in Scouting, spread across five sections: Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and the Scout Network. Each section has its own balanced programme of activities, badges and awards.

## [Beavers](/beavers/) (6–8)

Beaver Scouts are part of the worldwide Scout Movement.   Membership is open to boys and girls aged between 6 and 8 years old.
Beaver Scouting is all about having fun, playing games, making things, going on outings, meeting friends and gaining lots of badges.
To find out more simply come along on a Thursday night or contact Gavin Johnston on 01501 773519.

## [Cubs](/cubs.html) (8-10½)

A Cub Scout Pack can have up to 36 Cub Scouts and is split into smaller groups called Sixes. Cubs take part in a wide range of activities designed to be interesting and challenging. A Cub Scout meeting consists of games and activities with plenty of time spent outdoors.

Camps and holidays are some of the most memorable events of the year for Cubs.

## [Scouts](/scouts/) (10½–14)


Each Scout Troop consists of small units of six to eight Scouts called a Patrol, usually led by a Patrol Leader. Outdoor activities feature prominently, with the highlight being camping. Throughout the year, Scouts learn various skills, such as map reading, camp cooking and first aid in preparation for camp.

Rock climbing, potholing, gliding, photography and international experiences are just some of the things they get up to.

## [Explorer Scouts](/explorers/) (14–18)

Explorers are encouraged to lead themselves in deciding the programme
and direction of the Unit, with support and guidance from leaders. The section also includes the Young Leaders’ Scheme, where young people are able to take on a leadership role in one of the younger sections.

There is wider scope for activities like offshore sailing, campaigning, performing, parascending, mountaineering and expeditions.

## Scout Network (18-25)

Scout Network is the fifth and final section of the Scouting movement. Scout Network members take part in a variety of activities, which they undertake and organise themselves with the support of a Scout Network Leader.

Example activities include abseiling, camping, circus skills, climbing, go-karting, gorge walking, hiking, pioneering and watersports.
