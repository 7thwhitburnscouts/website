Whitburn Scout Group is currently looking for a number of adult volunteers to help with the running of the Group.

Become part of an experienced team. It can be hugely worthwhile and enjoyable. It's a chance to
gain new skills, boost your CV, meet new people and put something back into your community.
Allow us to give young people the chance to experience the fabulous range of fun activities 

Scouting can offer and for them to gain skills for life.
- Scouts and Explorer Scouts meet on Tuesdays
- Beavers and Cubs meet on Thursdays
- We are also looking for a Treasurer
