ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2025

The Scout Groupâ€™s AGM will take place on Tuesday 6 May 2025 at 7 pm in Brucefield Church Halls.

We anticipate the meeting - consisting of the election of Office Bearers, Section reports, presentation of accounts and GSL report - to last no longer the 30 minutes.

I very much hope you can come along.

Thank you in anticipation for your support. 

Best regards

Gavin Johnston
