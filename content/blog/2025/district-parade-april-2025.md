DISTRICT PARADE, LINLITHGOW - SUNDAY 27 APRIL 2025

The District Church Parade and Service is scheduled to take place on **Sunday 27 April 2025**.  As in the past, a bus will transport everyone to and from Linlithgow.  Members from all sections are strongly encouraged to attend this event, which will involve Scouts from all over West Lothian.  We appreciate everyone is busy, but improved parade attendance is always an area the Scout Group is keen to improve upon.

**Members are asked to be at Brucefield Church for 1.20 pm** on the day to allow the bus to depart at 1.30 pm.  We ask that full uniform is worn, including necker, dark school trousers/skirt and shoes.  A collection for charity is traditionally taken during the service.  **We intend returning to Brucefield Church at around 4.15 pm**.  

If your child is attending, please could the parental consent form below be completed and returned to any Leader before the Easter holidays.   We require this consent for your child to attend. 

There is a possibility of spare seats on the bus.  If any family members wish to join their son/daughter, please speak to a Section Leader or contact me directly.

If you have any queries about this parade, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact your Section Leader.

Thank you in anticipation for your support.
