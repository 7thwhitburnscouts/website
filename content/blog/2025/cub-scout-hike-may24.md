The Cub Pack and Scout Troop are planning to go on a hike up Tinto Hill on Saturday 24th May.

Cubs and Scouts should meet at the Tinto Hill Car Park, just off the A73 (nearest postcode ML12 6HU) at 10am, and be collected from the same location at 1.30pm. If your child requires a lift, please speak to a leader to arrange this.

There will be no cost for this event. We ask that all Cubs and Scouts bring a packed lunch with them and plenty of fluids (ideally all in a rucksack which can be carried on the walk with them). Taking sun cream is also advisable, weather dependent. We would recommend wearing walking boots for the activity if possible; sturdy trainers are a suitable alternative.

Please complete the attached form and return it by Tuesday 20th/Thursday 22nd May if you wish your child to take part in this event.

As always, if you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Scott Gilchrist
Assistant Cub Scout Leader
