The Cubs recently had a memorable visit to Bathgate Fire Station. We were given a guided tour of the station and had the chance to see where the fire fighters spend their time when they are not out on a call; it was fascinating. We were also shown around a fire engine and all the equipment that is used in fighting fires and rescuing people. The highlight of our visit was getting to use the fire hose to shoot water into the car park. The only dissapointing thing was that we didn't get to slide down the poles. (Something to do with health and safety. Hmph).

Thanks to Blue Watch for a wonderful time!
