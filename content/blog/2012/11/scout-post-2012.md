The Scout Group’s Christmas Post Service began in 1986. Since then over 529,000 cards have been delivered to the citizens of Whitburn, East Whitburn and Redmill – and often beyond!

The money raised through the Post ensures the functioning of the Group from one year to next. It also enables us to ensure Scouting is available to everyone without placing a financial burden on families as the money is used to pay all our membership fees to the Scout Association, allows us to provide free camps and outings for our young people and to pay for transport to many events.

For the price of 15p per card, members of the public can send cards to Whitburn, East Whitburn and Redmill.

Cards can be posted at the following shops/businesses from **Saturday 1 December** until **Friday 21 December 2012**:

The Group is indebted to the above businesses for their tremendous support and efforts with the Scout Post.

**Every** effort is taken to ensure we provide a quality service to the public – each card is as important to us as it is to the sender and recipient. The public can help us greatly with this by ensuring all cards are correctly addressed with a **full name**, **house number** and **street**. Every year, a large number of incorrectly addressed cards are posted and many of these often require considerable research.

Deliveries will normally take place during Saturday mornings and Sunday and Friday afternoons. Please note that Scouts and adult helpers cannot accept cards for posting from the public whilst out delivering.

Any comments or questions regarding the service should be made to Group Scout Leader Gordon Johnston on 0131 311 1179.
