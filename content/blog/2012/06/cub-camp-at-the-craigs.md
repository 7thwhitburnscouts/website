The cubs returned from a successful weekend Cub Camp at the Craigs. Â We had a great time, learning new things like fire lighting, putting up tents and backwoods cooking. We took a walk into Torphichen to play in the play park. Our favourite things were the adventure playground, camp fire and our chippy dinner. We were really well behaved at bedtime and the leaders got loads of sleep. (Just wait until group camp in September)
