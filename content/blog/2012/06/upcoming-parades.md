training shoes please as this is the main event of the year where we can really show off to the Whitburn Community! Beavers are asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform.

Younger members will only be dismissed when parents arrive to collect them.

We hope that the turnout to both these parades reflect numbers we see regularly at camps and outings. If you have any queries regarding either of these events, please contact the section leaders on the numbers below.
