The Cub Pack are planning to go camping to The Craigs, Torphichen on Friday 4th to Sunday 6th May 2012. The Craigs is our local Campsite. The Cubs will be planning to camp under canvas for at least one of the nights, weather permitting. We have also booked indoor accommodation (The Joe Hall Chalet) for use throughout the weekend. As we may be camping in tents, please try to avoid sleeping bags which are intended for indoor use only.

We will leave Brucefield Church on the Friday at 6.15pm prompt; hence we would be grateful if those attending could be present no later than 6pm. We will arrive back to Brucefield Church on the Sunday around 4pm. Transport will either be by coach or by leaders’ and parents’ cars. If you are able to help out by providing transport, please note this on your child’s return slip.

The free camp this year will be the Group Camp in September (as this is the most expensive one). As a result, the cost of this camp will be £20. We appreciate that this is a sizeable outlay on the top of the term’s £20 subscription however please be reassured that we are heavily subsidising the camp as much as we can in order to keep parental costs to a minimum. Anyone who may have difficulty meeting these costs can contact me at any time, in confidence, and we will sort something out.

You will also receive a ‘Nights Away Information Form’. This document should be read carefully and the lower half completed fully, and returned to any Section Leader, along with the £20 (cash or cheque) before the 26th April.

If you have any queries or questions regarding any of the above details, please do not hesitate to contact me for further clarification.
