**THURSDAY 4 OCTOBER 2012** 

As the 7th West Lothian Scout Group’s annual accounts were not available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting earlier in the year, an extraordinary general meeting will be held on Thursday 4 October at 8pm in the McMartin Hall in order to present our annual accounts.  Should you wish to attend this short meeting, you will be made very welcome.  Equally, if you are unable to attend but would like a copy of the accounts, please contact Gordon Johnston who will arrange for a set of accounts to be sent to you.
