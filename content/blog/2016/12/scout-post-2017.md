The Scout Post for 2016 made its final delivery yesterday.

We delivered 12,142 cards and have raised around £2200 for Group funds.  This compares with 13,846 and £2600 in 2015.

MANY THANKS to everyone who helped in anyway - collecting, sorting, researching and delivering cards.

Thanks also to everyone who used the service and to all our collection points throughout the town for their terrific support.
