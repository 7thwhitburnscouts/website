Due to an event taking place in the church hall next (Thursday 21st April) the Cubs are unable to use the hall.

As an alternative, we have decided to take them ten-pin bowling to Deer Park in Livingston.   Cubs should aim to be at the venue for 6.30pm to start bowling at 6.45pm. We plan to have one game of bowling (as well as a soft drink) and Cubs should be collected from Deer Park at around 7.30pm.

If anyone has any issues with transport, don't hesitate to get in touch.

Beavers is on at the church hall as usual.
