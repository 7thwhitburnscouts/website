Whitburn Gala Week begins on Sunday, the 19th June, with the annual Songs of Praise Parade and Service.

We are assembling at Whitburn Bowling Club car park for 2.15 pm,  parading to Whitburn Academy for the service and a plan returning to the Bowling Club at approximately 4.15 pm.

We ask that full uniform be worn and that in continuing our aim to improve parade attendance, as many members come along as possible.
