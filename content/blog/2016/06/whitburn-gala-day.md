Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorer Scouts are all asked to gather at Brucefield Church car park for 10.15 am on Saturday (25th June) for the Gala Day Procession.

We understand that some members will be walking with their school or other youth organisation but if you're not, walk with us.  Please remember, a key aim of the Group for this year is to improve parade attendance.

Please can full uniform be worn - shirt or sweatshirt, necker, smart trousers and shoes.  We have ponchos in the event of unkind weather and juice and sweets to keep us going.

Everyone can be collected at around 12 noon at King George V Park - top end, close to Park View/Bog Road end.  Look out for the Group's flags.

HAPPY GALA DAY!
