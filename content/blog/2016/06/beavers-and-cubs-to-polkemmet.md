The Beavers and Cubs will be having their last meeting before the summer break at Polkemmet Country Park on Thursday.

We're meeting at the car park near the Visitor Centre at 6 pm and will be departing again at 7.30 pm.

As always, we'll sort out some crisps and juice.

The weather's looking dry at the moment so see you there.  (Please remember that sadly, if the weather's poor, we'll need to cancel the evening as the church halls are being used for the EU Referendum.)
