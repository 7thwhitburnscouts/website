Thank you so much to everyone who used the Christmas Post in 2015.  13,846 cards were delivered raising over £2622 for Group funds.  This compares with 14,478 cards delivered and £2730 raised in 2014.

 

All money raised enables us to ensure Scouting is available to everyone by being used to pay membership fees to the Scout Association, provide free camps/outings for our young people and the general running of the Group.

 

Thank you to all the leaders, members, families and the shops and premises who supported the Post once again.
