All able members are asked to assemble in the car park behind the Burgh Halls on Sunday (13th November) for 10.15 am.

We will parade from there, at around 10.40 am, to the Cenotaph at Whitburn Community Centre. After a short service at the Cenotaph, all participants will move over to Whitburn South Church for the Remembrance Service. The parade will then return to the Masonic Hall for a light lunch.  Proceedings should finish around 1.15 pm. If preferred, parents can collect their children at the end of the parade (around 12.45 pm).

Please can we ask that full uniform is worn as well as smart trousers.  If possible, warm underclothes would be sensible.
