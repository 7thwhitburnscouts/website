The Cub pack recently had their first ever Pack Forum as part of the new [Teamwork](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4337/teamwork-challenge-award/?cat=12,67,778) challenge badg[![2015cu-cs-tea](https://7thwhitburnscouts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7ff5b-2015cu-cs-tea.png?w=150&h=150)](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4337/teamwork-challenge-award/?cat=12,67,778)e.  Items discussed were suggestions for future outings, favourite TV shows and any other business.  The cubs first chose a chairman, Katie, and then a secretary, Cameron.  Katie lead the meeting whilst Cameron took notes.  The teamwork badge involves lots of team building and games where the cubs learn how to work as a team; communicating, co-operating, roles and encouragement.   As a result of the first pack forum, we agreed that the hall needs more colour and the sixes would like their own corner.  For future outings, the idea of a Blackpool trip was ruled out as being too far away, but the idea of a trip to the Science center sounds good. In the last week, there will be another pack forum with the cubs coming up with what to discuss this week.
