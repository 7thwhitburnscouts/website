We're going to go ahead with our planned visit to Polkemmet tonight.

We're meeting in the car park near to the play park and Visitors Centre at 6 pm and intend leaving at 7.30 pm.

IT'S BEEN A BLUSTERY DAY SO PLEASE DRESS APPROPRIATELY - DEFINITELY A JACKET AND SENSIBLE SHOES/WELLIES WOULD BE GOOD.

See you there.
