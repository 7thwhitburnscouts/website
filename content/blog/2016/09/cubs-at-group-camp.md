The Cubs visited Bonaly Scout Centre last week as part of the 7th Whitburn's Group Camp.  They enjoyed a hike with excellent views of Edinburgh, pedal carts, earth ball, grass sledging, shelter building, camping in excellent weather, a trip to the tuck shop and George's mince and tatties.  Less enjoyable were the wasps but they didn't stop anyone from having a great time.
