The Scout Group has been awarded £900 from the Co-op's Local Fund initiative where money paid for the purchase of carrier bags goes towards local organisations.

 

The Group will use this money to purchase new 3-man tents.

 

Whitburn Store Manager, David Brownlees came along to present us with the cheque.

 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to vote for us - we came in second place!
