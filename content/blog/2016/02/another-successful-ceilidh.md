Thank you to everyone who attended the 14th annual ceilidh in Whitburn Bowling Club on Friday 19 February.  The fantastic sum of £824.77 was raised for the Scout Group.  The dance floor was never empty, the buffet plates were cleared and all the terrific raffle prizes claimed!  Everyone is thanked for their tremendous generosity and a special thank you to Ceebar Properties Ltd for their very kind donation for the Dutch Auction.  And well done to Louise for pulling it all together!
