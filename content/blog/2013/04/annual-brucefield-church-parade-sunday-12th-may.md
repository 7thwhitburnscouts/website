In the event of inclement weather prior to the parade returning, the organisations will be taken to the Games Hall at the Church where parents can collect their children. Notice of this will be relayed to parents at Bog Road.

All members of the Scout Group are strongly encouraged to attend this event. It is one of very few opportunities we have to show just how strong Scouting is in Whitburn. If your son/daughter is unable to attend, please notify you son/daughter’s section leader.

If you have any problems or queries, please don’t hesitate to contact your Section Leader or myself.
