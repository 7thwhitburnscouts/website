Last summer the Scouts went to Polkemmet to search for geocaches. Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.

One of the things you can do with geocaching is to put a Travel Bug into a geocache. A Groundspeak Travel Bug is a trackable tag that you attach to an item. This allows you to track your item on Geocaching.com. The item becomes a hitchhiker that is carried from cache to cache (or person to person) in the real world and you can follow its progress online.

Graeme created the 7th Whitburn Scouts Travel Bug Dog tag with a goal to get to Brownsea Island in Dorset. This was the location of the first Scout camp led by Baden Powell in 1907


On the 29th June Graeme placed the Travel Bug in Dancing Tree which is a geocache near Forth. In August, a user called Clarinet2 took the Travel Bug and put it in a geocache called CastleHill Bluebells which is in Ayr. On the 25th September, a user called leo.hafs retrieved it from the cache and said he was going to take it closer to Dorset.

We will update the blog the next time something happens to the bug.
