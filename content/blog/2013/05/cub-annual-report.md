**Cub Report 2013**

The Cubs have had a really busy and exciting year. We currently have 35 Cubs in the pack; however, 5 of them are linking with the Scouts at the moment.

Last May we had our Cub camp at the Craigs, where we learned how to put up tents, fire-lighting skills, and lots of other fun things.

In June, we took part in all the usual civic week activities, including the Songs of Praise and Gala day parades. We also regained the Junior Gala Quiz Trophy.

In September, we went to Fordell Firs for the Group camp, where we had another great time, trying things like grass sledging, karting and archery. The Beavers visited the camp on the Saturday and took part in a massive game of steal, where

it is alleged that some of the older members of the group were cheating.

We had our usual Hallowe’en party in October, and everyone dressed up.

In November, some of the pack attended the Remembrance Day Parade and Service. There was a good attendance and the service was even linked through to the hall because it was so busy.

We also visited Bathgate fire Station in November, where we had a tour of the station, were shown round a fire engine, and got to skoosh a fire hose into the car park. It was a great night.

In January, we went to the pantomime at the King’s Theatre in Glasgow. This year it was ‘Cinderella’. Thanks to Gavin for organising it, although we almost didn’t make it to the theatre, as the bus was decidedly dodgy.

Throughout the year we have done lots of badge work: the Scientist, Local Knowledge and Home Safety activity badges, Emergency Aid stage 2, as well as the Community challenge badge. We are currently working towards gaining the Communicator badge.

The Cubs have also worked on badges on their own, with the Collector badge being the most popular.

We are looking forward to returning to the Craigs at the end of next week for our annual Cub camp, with loads of fun activities planned. Pray that it stays dry.

Before that, we have our Brucefield Church parade, which allows us to show ourselves of to the community; hope we get a good attendance.

We are also looking forward to the Civic week festivities. Can we make it three in a row with the quiz?

Then, to finish the term off, we are going to Polkemmet Park with the Beavers. More nice weather please!

This year, our leadership team has consisted mainly of Paul and Neil, with Gordon helping out when he can. Since last year, we have lost Andrew, but have recruited Nathan and press ganged Steven. Hopefully, the pack can continue going from strength to strength.
