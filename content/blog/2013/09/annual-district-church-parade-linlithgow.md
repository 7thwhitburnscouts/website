This year, the annual District Church Parade and Service will take place on **Sunday 6th October** in Linlithgow.  As with previous years, a coach has been booked to transport everyone to Linlithgow to take part in this important Church Parade and Service.  Members of all sections are encouraged to attend as this is the best opportunity in the year to show off to the District the size of our Group.

**All members should report to Brucefield Church at 1.20pm** on the day to allow the bus to depart no later than 1.30pm prompt.  As we are in full view of the general public, **it is important that we are all smartly turned out**. (Cubs and Scouts please wear dark school trousers and shoes if possible.)

We intend to **return to Brucefield Church at around 4.50pm.**  This time is a best estimate. (It will very much depend on the length of the service.)  There is a possibility that there will be a few spare seats on the bus.  If any family members wish to join their son/daughter, please speak to a Section Leader or contact me separately for details.  Spaces will be allocated on a first come, first served, basis. **A letter with consent form has been sent out, if you have not received the letter, please ask for a copy from a Leader as soon as possible.**   We require this consent for your child to attend. Thank you for your co-operation.
