The Scout Group would like to thank everyone who used the Scout Christmas Post service last year and to all shops and premises that once again accepted cards and supported the venture. 

A total of 4,900 cards were delivered raising over £1400 for Group funds.  This compares with 8,100 cards delivered and £2300 raised in 2019 when the Post last operated.  All money raised enables us to ensure Scouting is available to everyone by being used to pay membership fees to the Scout Association, provide free camps/outings for our young people and the general running of the Group.
