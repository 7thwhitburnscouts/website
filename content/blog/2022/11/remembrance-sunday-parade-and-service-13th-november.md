The above parade and service will take place on Sunday 13th November 2022. Please note that this event has always been considered an ‘optional’ parade for members as it can be a very cold day and the service deals with sombre themes.

However, we would like to extend an invite, as mentioned, on an optional basis, to all members. If your child wishes to do so, they would be made very welcome for this very significant parade and service.

**Due to continuing building work at the Burgh Halls, once again we are assembling in the car park behind Tastes Café, Armadale Road at 10.15 am on the Sunday morning.**

We will parade from Armadale Road, at around 10.30 am, to the Cenotaph at Whitburn Community Centre. After a short service at the Cenotaph, all participants will move over to Whitburn South Church for the Remembrance Service. The parade will then return to  
Armadale Road and then the Masonic Hall for refreshments and a snack. Proceedings should finish around 1.15 pm. If preferred, parents can collect their children at the end of the parade at around 12.30 pm.

All members in attendance are asked to wear their uniform as well as smart trousers. If possible, warm underclothes should be worn or a jacket.

If you have any queries about this parade, please don’t hesitate to contact me or your child’s Section Leader.

Thank you in anticipation for your support.
