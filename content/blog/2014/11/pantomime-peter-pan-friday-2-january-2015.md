Pantomime - Peter Pan - Friday 2 January 2015

We intend taking the entire Scout Group to Peter Pan at The King's Theatre, Glasgow on Friday 2 January 2015.

The cost of this event will be £12.50. This covers the cost of the theatre ticket with the Scout Group paying for the buses using money raised from the Scout Post.

We intend leaving Brucefield Church at 12.30 pm on the Friday afternoon for the pantomime starting at 2 pm. We anticipate returning to Whitburn at around 5.30 pm. Full uniform should be worn. We will remind you of these arrangements nearer the time.  In order for your son or daughter to attend this event, please complete the Consent Form that was sent out and return it to their section leader along with £12.50 by Tuesday 2 December for Scouts and Explorer Scouts and Thursday 4 December for Beavers and Cub Scouts.

**PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT SPACES ARE LIMITED AND WILL BE ALLOCATED ON A FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED BASIS.**

As always, if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact any of the leaders.
