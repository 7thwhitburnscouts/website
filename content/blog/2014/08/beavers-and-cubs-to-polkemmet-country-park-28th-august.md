The church halls are being used for the induction of the new Brucefield minister on Thursday 28 August 2014.

We have therefore decided to visit Polkemmet Country Park. As with our previous visit, we ask that Beavers and Cubs be dropped off at Polkemmet at 6pm and collected once again at 7:30 pm. Â We plan to gather at and depart from the car park nearest to the adventure play area.

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform along with sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on weather.

NOTE: If it is raining at all sadly the evening will have to be cancelled as no alternative accommodation is available to us.
