A total of 15,166 cards were delivered raising over £2975 for Group funds. This compares with 16,128 cards delivered and £2258 raised in 2012. The Scout Group would like to thank everyone who used the Scout Christmas Post service and especially to all the shops and premises that once



again accepted cards and supported the venture.

All money raised enables us to ensure Scouting is available to everyone by being used to pay membership fees to the Scout Association, provide free camps/outings for our young people and the general running of the Group.
