As a result of the Church Halls being used for the European Parliamentary elections on Thursday 22 May 2014 we are planning to take both the Cub and Beaver Scouts to Polkemmet Country Park on that evening.

We ask that the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - are dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm. We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area - close to the park's Visitor Centre. Parents may of course wish to consider sharing transport if convenient.

If transport is an issue please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on the weather. Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.

As with other outings to Polkemmet, if it is raining at all sadly the evening will have to be cancelled as no alternative accommodation is available to us.

Please do not go to Polkemmet if the weather is not suitable for being outdoors. Please use your own judgement and if in doubt, contact me on at 743288 AFTER 4.30 PM ON THE THURSDAY EVENING. We will also post any information on our website and Facebook page.

As always, if you have any questions or problems please don't hesitate to speak to any of the leaders.

Thank you and best regards

Neil and Gavin
