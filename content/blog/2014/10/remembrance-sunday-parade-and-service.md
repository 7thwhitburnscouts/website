The Remembrance Sunday parade and service will take place on Sunday 9th November 2014. A few years ago, the Scouts, Explorers, Network and Adult Leaders attended this parade. It has always been considered an ‘optional’ parade for members as it can be a very cold day and the service deals with sombre themes.

Again, this year, we would like to extend an invite, on an optional basis, to all sections. There is no requirement to attend. However, if your child wishes to do so, they would be made very welcome for this very significant parade and service.

The details are as follows: Members are asked to assemble in the car park behind the Burgh Halls at 10.15am on the Sunday morning. Following a short prayer, we will parade from the there, at around 10.40am, to the Cenotaph at Whitburn Community Centre. After a short service at the Cenotaph, all participants will move over to Whitburn South Church for the Remembrance Service. The parade will then return to the Masonic Hall for a light lunch. Proceedings should finish around 1.15pm. If preferred, parents can collect their children at the end of the parade (around 12.50pm). All members in attendance are asked to wear their uniform as well as smart trousers for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers. If possible, warm underclothes should be worn.

If you have any queries about this parade, please don’t hesitate to contact your Section Leader. Thank you in anticipation for your support.

Yours in Scouting

Gordon Johnston

Group Scout Leader
