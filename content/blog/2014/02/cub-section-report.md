Cub Section Report  
February 2014

Currently, there are 30 Cubs in the pack: 8 moved up from Beavers in November, and there were 4 direct entries between September and November and 1 re-entry. Five Beavers are currently linking with the Pack. One Cub moved to Scouts before Christmas, and there are 4 Cubs who are now aged to move to Scouts and will start linking in March.

Since the summer, the pack has been very busy. We had 16 Cubs at the group camp at Auchengillan in September where they took part in the various activities that had been organised. Thanks to Gavin and George for arranging this.

We also completed the Scottish Cub Challenge badge, which involved walking the distance of the height of Ben Nevis, learning about St Andrew, comparing the longest rivers, biggest mountains etc. in Scotland with others in Europe and around the world. We also learned some Scottish songs and the Dashing White Sergeant, which also earned the pack the entertainer badge. The singing and dancing took place on St Andrew’s night, so we had to indulge in shortbread and Irn Bru.

We had our customary Hallowe’en party at the end of October, where everyone got dressed up. This was another fun packed evening of traditional activities.

We had 3 Cubs attend the Remembrance Day parade.

December saw various fun packed evenings, finishing with a games night before the Christmas break.

During the holidays we went to the pantomime (‘Aladdin’) at the Kings Theatre in

Glasgow - another fabulous show. Thanks once again to Gavin for organising this.

The pack has just completed the Map Reader badge. This involved learning about grid references, compass points and ordnance survey symbols.

We plan to do the Astronomer badge and the Athlete badge in the coming months, and also hope to do the Camper badge and Outdoor Challenge badge at our Cub camp in April.

Thanks once again to our leadership team, Paul, Steven and Neil. Also to Mark McGuire and Aimee Spinks who have recently started helping out.
