The Cubs have recently returned from their annual camp at the Craigs (4th-6th April).

Twenty-two Cubs attended, as well as two very well-behaved Scouts and four extremely helpful Explorer Scouts and, of course, the leaders.

Although the site was damp underfoot, the weather held and stayed dry to allow the pack to take part in the numerous activities which were organised.

The pack learned how to pitch tents and light fires; they also took part in pioneering, tracking and a treasure hunt, as well as a fun-packed afternoon at the adventure playground.

They also had a great time at the camp fire on Saturday night, with some of the younger ones learning a few new songs.

We returned to Whitburn on Sunday afternoon, tired, grubby, but extremely happy. A great time was had by all.
