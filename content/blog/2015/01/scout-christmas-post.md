Thank you to everyone who used the Scout Christmas Post service last year and to all shops and premises that once again accepted cards and supported the venture.

 

A total of 14,478 cards were delivered raising over £2730 for Group funds. This compares with 15,166 cards delivered and £2975 raised in 2013.

 

All money raised enables us to ensure Scouting is available to everyone by being used to pay membership fees to the Scout Association, provide free camps/outings for our young people and the general running of the Group.
