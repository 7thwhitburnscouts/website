This year, the annual District Church Parade and Service will take place on **Sunday 26 April** in Linlithgow. As with previous years, a coach has been booked to transport everyone to Linlithgow to take part in this important Church Parade and Service. Members of all sections are encouraged to attend as this is agood opportunity in the year to show others the strength of Scouting in Whitburn.

All members should report to Brucefield Church at **1.20pm** on the day to allow the bus to depart no later than 1.30pm prompt. As we are in full view of the general public, it is important that we are all smartly turned out. (Cubs and Scouts please wear dark school trousers and shoes if possible.)

We intend to return to Brucefield Church at around **4.50pm**. This time is a best estimate. (It will very much depend on the length of the service.) There is a possibility that there will be a few spare seats on the bus. If any family members wish to join their son/daughter, please speak to a Section Leader or contact me separately for details. Spaces will be allocated on a first come, first served, basis.Â Please complete the parental consent form handed out at meetings and return to any Leader as soon as possible. We require this consent for your child to attend. Thank you for your cooperation.
