**Civic Week Parade**

The annual Civic Week Songs of Praise Parade and Service will take place on **Sunday 21st June** at Whitburn Academy. The arrangements for this parade are as follows:

All section members are asked to assemble in the **Bowling Club Car Park at 2.15pm** and they will return at approximately 4.15pm. Members are asked to wear full uniform – no joggers or training shoes please! Beavers are asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform.

**Galaday Parade**

The Galaday Parade will take place on **Saturday 27th June**. The arrangements for this parade are as follows:

All section members are asked to assemble in **Brucefield Church Car Park at 10.15am**. Again, members are asked to wear full uniform – no joggers or training shoes please as this is the main event of the year where we can really show off to the Whitburn Community! Beavers are asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform. At the end of the Parade, parents should look for the Group Flags. We will hold them high so you can see where we are standing as a group. Younger members will only be dismissed when parents arrive to collect them.

We hope that the turnout to both these parades reflect numbers we see regularly at camps and outings. If you have any queries regarding either of these events, please contact the section leaders.
