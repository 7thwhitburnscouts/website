The above parade and service will take place on **Sunday 8th November 2015** starting in the car park behind the Burgh Halls at **10:15 am.**

Please note that this event has always been considered an ‘optional’ parade for members as it can be a very cold day and the service deals with sombre themes.

 

However, we would like to extend an invite, on an optional basis, to all sections.  There is no requirement to attend. But, if your child wishes to do so, they would be made very welcome for this very significant parade and service.

 

Members are asked to assemble in the car park behind the Burgh Halls at **10.15 am** on the Sunday morning. Following a short prayer, we will parade from there, at around 10.40 am, to the Cenotaph at Whitburn Community Centre. After a short service at the Cenotaph, all participants will move over to Whitburn South Church for the Remembrance Service. The parade will then return to the Masonic Hall for a light lunch. Proceedings should finish around **1.15 pm**. If preferred, parents can collect their children at the end of the parade (around 12.50 pm).

 

All members in attendance are asked to wear their uniform as well as smart trousers for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers. If possible, warm underclothes should be worn.

If you have any queries about this parade, please don’t hesitate to contact your Section Leader.
