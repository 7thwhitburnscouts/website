ANNUAL BRUCEFIELD CHURCH PARADE AND SERVICE OF UNIFORMED YOUTH ORGANISATIONS

The above parade and service will take place on Sunday 10th May 2015.

Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorer Scouts are asked to assemble in the Bowling Club Car Park, at **10.20am** on the Sunday morning. We should return to Bog Road after the church service at approximately **12.20pm**.

All members should wear their uniform as well as smart trousers for Cubs, Scouts and Explorers. A collection will be taken during the service.

In the event of inclement weather prior to the parade returning, the organisations will be taken to the Games Hall at the Church where parents can collect their children. Notice of this will be relayed to parents at Bog Road.

All members of the Scout Group are strongly encouraged to attend this event. It is one of very few opportunities we have to show how strong Scouting is in Whitburn. If your child is unable to attend, please notify your child's section leader.

If you have any problems or queries,please don't hesitate to contact the Section Leader. Thank you in anticipation of your support.
