Time is running out to vote for the Group's application to the Co-op's Local Fund.  We've applied for funding to help purchase some replacement tents.

If you're not a Co-operative member, please join - it doesn't take long - and support the Scout Group.   You can join at [www.co-operative.coop/membership](http://www.co-operative.coop/membership).

Please also encourage your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues to do the same!

Voting closes at 5 pm on the 11 December 2015.
