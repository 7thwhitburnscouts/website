We currently have 46 Beaver Scouts – 21 in the first and 25 in the second Colonies. 6 Beavers moved to Cubs in November 2014 and we have 7 Beavers aged to move to the Cubs but await spaces becoming available in the Cub Pack. 8 new members have joined us since December which is great.

 

Our recent activities have included a visit to Fordell Firs Scout Centre in Fife in September to join up with the rest of the Group at the annual Group Camp; on 18 September we had a rather foggy, but very enjoyable, evening a Redmill Play Park, East Whitburn as the church halls were being used for the Scottish Independence Referendum. Finally, on the 2 January 2015 the Beavers went to the pantomime at the Kings in Glasgow along with Scout Group. It was another fantastic – and noisy – day.

 

Our current planned activities for 2015 so far include a trip to Monster Mania indoor soft play on the 14 February, a joint meeting with the Cub Scouts at Polkemmet Country Park in May due to the halls being used for the General Election and our June trip is to Almond Valley, Livingston which we last visited in 2011.

 

We continue to award a great number of badges and the “Challenge Badge Cycle” continues as ever.   The Fitness and Friendship Challenge badges were awarded between September and November last year. We are currently working on the Promise Challenge badge and this will be completed and presented during February. The Scout Association has launched a whole new Beaver Scout Programme, badges and awards and we will need to spend time looking into the planning and implementation of these.

 

Olive retired from the leadership team on the 18 December. She has been an invaluable part of the team bringing tremendous patience and ability to cope with any situation, unfazed. She will be greatly missed and is thanked for all her time, effort and brilliant programmes over many years.

 

Other leadership news includes Neil’s warrant being finalized and Caitlin continues to be a real asset to the Beaver Section. Everyone is thanked, as always, for their superb input and efforts.
