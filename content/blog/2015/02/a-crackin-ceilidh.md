The Group would like to thank everyone who attended the 13th annual ceilidh in Whitburn Bowling Club on Friday 20 February. Along with a night filled with dancing, provided by The Alan Crookston Ceilidh Band, there was a raffle, Dutch Auction and buffet.  The fantastic sum of £812.63 was raised for the Scout Group. Everyone is thanked for their tremendous generosity and a special thank you to all the new faces that came along this year.  (And well done to Louise for organising it all!)
