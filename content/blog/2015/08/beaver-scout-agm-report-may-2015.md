We currently have 42 Beaver Scouts. Five Beavers joined the Cubs in April and a further four are due to join before the summer break.

 

We have had an exceptionally busy year including:

 

- May 2014 – joint meeting at Polkemmet Country Park along with Cubs due to halls and an outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park outing. An excellent day was had and the weather was glorious.
- September 2014 – visited Fordell Firs, near Dunfermline, where the Group Camp was taking place. It was great joining the Cubs, Scouts and Explorers and visiting the Fordell's adventure play area.  Also in September we had a (foggy) evening at Redmill Play Park, East Whitburn when the church halls being used for the Scottish Independence Referendum.
- On 2 January 2015 we went to the Pantomime Peter Pan along with rest of Scout Group
- In February 2015 we went to Monster Mania, the indoor soft play in Falkirk.
- The Beaver Scouts have continued to attend the four parades we take part in each year - District Parade in Linlithgow in April, Brucefield Church Parade and Service in May and the two Civic Week parades in June - the Songs of Praise and the Gala Day procession.

 

The “Challenge Badge cycle” continues as ever with the six badges being award during the course of the year as a result of Thursday night programmes.  The Promise Challenge badge was awarded prior to Easter and we are currently working on the Creativity Challenge badge due for completion before the summer break.

 

The new Activity Badges have been implemented. 11 new activity badges were introduced last year with the Collectors badge proving particularly popular.

 

The Scout Association has made significant changes to the Beaver Scout Programme we are looking into and planning for the introduction of these new awards and badges ready for the required implementation date of September 2015.

 

Olive Thomson’s last meeting was on the 18 December. She has been an invaluable part of the team bringing tremendous patience and ability to cope with any situation unfazed. She will be greatly missed and is thanked for all her time, effort and brilliant programmes over many years.

 

Other leadership news includes Scott Gilchrist is now assisting with both colonies and Neil Brodie's warrant continues to be processed.

 

The entire leadership team is thanked, as always, for their superb input and efforts over 2014/2015 and we look forward to another terrific year ahead.
