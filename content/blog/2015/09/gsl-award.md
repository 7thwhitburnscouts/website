Congratulations to our former Group Scout Leader, Gordon Johnston, on being award the District Commissioner's Award for Service to West Lothian Scouting.  Gordon stepped down as GSL of the 7th after 13 years of outstanding hard work, time and commitment to the Group on the 30 June 2015.

 

However, he won't be disappearing altogether as the picture shows Gordon being presented with his award by District Commissioner Alex Brown at the 7th's recent Group Camp held at Auchengillan over the weekend of the 18 - 20 September 2015.
