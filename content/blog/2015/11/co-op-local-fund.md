The Group has applied for funding from the Co-operative’s “Local Fund”.  We’re hoping to replace some of our much-loved and well-used three-man tents.  We are guaranteed to receive money, but how much we get is determined by the number of votes we receive.

 

People can vote by going to:

 

[www.co-oplocalfund.co.uk](http://www.co-oplocalfund.co.uk)

 

and vote for the "West Lothian Whitburn Scout Group".

 

You need to be a Co-operative member so if you're not please do take the time to join - it doesn't take long - and support the Scout Group.   You can join at:

 

[www.co-operative.coop/membership](http://www.co-operative.coop/membership)

 

Please ask and encourage your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues to do the same!

 

Voting opened on Monday 16 November and closes at 5 pm on the 11 December 2015.

 

Thank you very much for your support.
