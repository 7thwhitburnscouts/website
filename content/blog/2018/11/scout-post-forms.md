Please can we ask that Scout Post rota forms be returned today, 13th November by Scouts and Explorers and on Thursday 15th November for Beaver and Cub Scouts.

 

The Scout Post is the Group's major fundraising event of the year and also a much relied upon service by many in the local community.

 

Every member benefits from the Scout Post.  The money is used to pay our membership fee to the Scout Association and to help fund the Group for the year ahead - reducing what we need to ask parents to pay.

 

Because all Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers gain from the Post we ask all families to help with one delivery.  Cards are already sorted, we try hard to give people delivery areas they know and will always provide as much help as possible.  It really is simple!

 

Many thanks for your support!
