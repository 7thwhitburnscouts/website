A number of letters have went out over recent weeks.  These have been in relation to:

 

1. Remembrance Sunday Parade and Service taking place on the 11 November 2018
2. Our annual Pantomime outing to the King's Theatre, Glasgow, this year to see Aladdin, on Sunday 30 December 2018
3. The annual Scout Post fundraising delivery service during much of the month of December and asking for families to assist with the delivery of cards
4. FOR BEAVER SCOUTS ONLY - the proposed outing to the Riverside/Transport Museum in Glasgow on Saturday 17 November 2018.

 

If you didn't receive any of these letters then please speak to a leader for a copy.

The pantomime and Beaver outings require a completed consent form returned by those wishing to attend.  We ask that all families do their upmost to help with the Scout Post as every member benefits from the money raised.

We'll post updates and reminders closer to the time of events.
