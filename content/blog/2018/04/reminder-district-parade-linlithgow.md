The District Parade - involving Scouts from all over West Lothian - takes place tomorrow, 22 April in Linlithgow.

 

The bus is leaving Brucefield Church at 1.30 pm.  We expect to return around 4.30 pm.  Everyone is asked to wear full uniform including smart trousers and shoes please.

 

**Parades are perhaps not as exciting as many of the other activities we do but they are part of being a Scout.  We would love to see as many people there that can attended.**  Let's show West Lothian what a strong and successful Scout Group Whitburn has!
