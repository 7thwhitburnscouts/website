The Scout Group is bag packing at B & M’s in Bathgate over the weekend of the 11th and 12th August 2018.  **We did this last year and the fantastic sum of £1085 was raised.**

 

This event will once again enable the Group to raise money that will go towards paying for outings, camps and the general running of the Group.   Such fundraising reduces the need to ask parents to pay for activities or how much money activities cost members.

 

We hope that members and their parents/guardians from all Sections will help with this venture by coming along and are proposing dividing up the days and slots as follows:

 

<table width="501"><tbody><tr><td width="106"><strong>Sat 11 August</strong></td><td width="71"><strong>Beavers</strong></td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 10 – 11.30 am</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 11.30 am – 1 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106"><strong>Sat 11 August</strong></td><td width="71"><strong>Explorers</strong></td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 1 – 2.30 pm</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 2.30 – 4 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106"><strong>Sun 12 August</strong></td><td width="71"><strong>Cubs</strong></td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 10 – 11.30 am</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 11.30 am – 1 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106"><strong>Sun 12 August</strong></td><td width="71"><strong>Scouts</strong></td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 1 – 2.30 pm</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 2.30 – 4 pm</td></tr></tbody></table>

 

The hope is that lots people will offer to help meaning that people may only have to do part of a Section’s allocated time.

 

If you are able to help then please contact Louise on 01501 773519, e-mail [louise.burton21@googlemail.com](mailto:louise.burton21@googlemail.com) or leave a message on the Group’s Facebook page.  We will contact you back with your allocated time.

 

**Many thanks in anticipation.**
