The weather is looking **glorious** for our joint meeting at Polkemmet Country Park tomorrow!

 

We ask that the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - are dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm.  We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area – close to the park’s Visitor Centre.  Parents may of course wish to consider sharing transport if convenient.

 

If transport is an issue please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

 

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible, outdoor footwear.  **With the weather looking so good it is advisable that sunscreen is applied before coming to the park and perhaps even a hat.**

 

Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.
