We are meeting in the car park behind Brucefield Church at 10.15 am.  We ask that everyone is smartly dressed with Scout jumper or shirt, necker, dark trousers and shoes.  The forecast is looking good therefore it looks like jackets won't be needed.  As good Scouts we are prepared; ponchos are at the ready!

 

Everyone can be collected at King George V Park - Park View/Bog Road end - at approximately 12 noon.  Look out for the Group flags.

 

Juice and some sweets will also be available during the parade.

 

We know it's a busy day; we know some kids will be walking with their school or other organisations; but if they can walk with the Scout Group, please encourage them to walk with the Scout Group.  Let's show Whitburn how strong Scouting is in the town!
