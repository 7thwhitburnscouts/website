The Gala Day Civic Week Parade and Service takes place tomorrow - Sunday 17th June.

We are assembling at Whitburn Bowling Club car park for 2.15 pm,  parading to Whitburn Academy for the service and plan returning to the Bowling Club at approximately 4.15 pm.

**We ask that full uniform be worn and that in continuing our aim to improve parade attendance, as many members come along as possible and thank parents in advance for their support with this.**
