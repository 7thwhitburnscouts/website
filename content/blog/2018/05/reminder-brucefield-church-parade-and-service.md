The Brucefield Church Parade and Service takes place on Sunday, 13th May 2018.

 

Members are asked to gather at Whitburn Bowling Club at 10.20 am for the parade leaving at approximately 10.35 am.  We intend returning to the Bowling Club at around 12.15 pm.

 

Everyone is asked to wear full uniform, including smart trousers and shoes.  A collection will be taken during the service.

 

**Parades are perhaps not as exciting as many of the other activities we do but they are part of being a Scout.  We would love to see as many people there that can attended.  Let's show Whitburn what a strong and successful Scout Group we are!**
