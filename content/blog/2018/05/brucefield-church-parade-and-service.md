Many thanks to everyone who came along to the Brucefield Church Parade and Service yesterday.

We had a good turnout, the weather was kind and Brucefield Church's Minster, Sandy Roger, gave us a very effective and fun service.

A particular thank you to Ian McGregor, Group Sectional Assistant, for all his work and time organising the event.
