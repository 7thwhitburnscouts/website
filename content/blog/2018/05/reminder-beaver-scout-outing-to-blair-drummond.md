The bus for tomorrow's trip to Blair Drummond Safari and Adventure Park leaves Brucefield Church at 9.30 am tomorrow - Saturday 26th May.  We intend being back at the Church for around 4 pm.

 

**The forecast is looking very good, but please can we remind everyone that UNIFORM IS REQUIRED.**

 

As is a packed lunch - preferably in a backpack to leave hands free - and there is a shop which will no doubt be visited.

 

Any issues or concerns, please get in touch.
