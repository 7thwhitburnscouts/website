Congratulations to Peter McGuire Jnr (left) and Zack Renwick (centre), both Sectional Assistant Leaders - Beaver Scouts, for completing all their leader training.  They were presented with their Wood Badges at the Group AGM on Thursday 10th May by West Lothian Deputy District Commissioner Colin Thorpe.

 

Both Peter and Zack have worked really hard over several years to complete all the necessary modules to achieve their Wood Badges.  Very well done!
