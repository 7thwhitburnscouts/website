Letters have went out promoting the upcoming Scout Group AGM  and Brucefield Church Parade.

 

The AGM is taking place this Thursday, the 10th May at 8 pm in Brucefield Church.

 

Group Office Bearers will be elected - don't worry, we are fortunate that all those in post have kindly decided to remain!  Section and GSL reports will be given and the Group Accounts presented.  We anticipate it lasting around 30 minutes.  Please come along and show your support for the Scout Group and the fantastic work of the leadership team.

 

Also, the Brucefield Church Parade takes place next Sunday, the 13th May involving the Scout Group, Brownies and Guides from Brucefield.   We will assemble at Whitburn Bowling Club car park at 10.15 am.  We anticipate returning to the Bowling Club at around 12.20 pm.

 

We strongly encourage all members of the Scout Group to attend and ask that full uniform, including smart trousers and shoes, are worn please.

 

Thank you so much in anticipation of your support with these two important events.
