Scout Group meetings have now stopped for the summer holidays.

 

It's been a very busy couple of months what with parades, camps, outings and of course weekly meetings.  Thanks to everyone for their attendance, efforts and support.

 

Have a great summer, stay safe and we look forward to seeing everyone in August!
