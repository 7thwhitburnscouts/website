The Group's Family Ceilidh is due to take place on Friday 5 October 2018.

 

In order for the Group to be able to cover the cost of the band and food and there being enough people to make the event a fun and worthwhile evening for all there, we really need more people to come along.

 

It is taking place in Whitburn Bowling Club starting at 7.30 pm.  Tickets cost £9 for adults and £4.50 for children.  Along with some ceilidh dancing there is a raffle and buffet.  It is very much an informal occasion and no previous ceilidh experience is necessary - it really is all just a bit of fun!

 

**If you can, please support this event.  Come along.  Bring your family, friends, colleagues and neighbours.**

 

Speak to any leader or call Louise or Gavin on 01501 773519 for tickets or more information.
