We have taken the decision to cancel the ceilidh which was due to take place on Friday 5th October 2018.

 

Whilst the annual ceilidh began more as a social event rather than a fundraiser - although it has raised a considerable sum of money for Group funds over the years - the number of tickets sold would not be sufficient to cover the cost of the event this year.  We were also concerned that the number of people due to attend would make it difficult for it to be a viable and fun event.  As a Scout Group, we rarely cancel events but under the circumstances we felt this was the best decision to make.

 

A full refund will be given and we apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment caused.

 

Many thanks to everyone who bought tickets and to all the Leaders for their efforts in encouraging and selling tickets.
