Our current Scout Leader, Graeme Brown, intends stepping down from the role due to increased work commitments.  We are therefore looking for someone to take on the position of Scout Leader.

 

Graeme very much intends remaining part of the Group and helping wherever and whenever possible - including with any possible transition.  In addition, whoever we hopefully find to take on this role, would be joining the existing and established team already at the Scouts and would receive all the support myself and the Scout Group can provide and is needed.  The person will in no-way be on their own!

 

Ideally, we are looking for someone who can make a regular, weekly commitment and take on all aspects of running the Scout Troop along with George Campbell and Peter McGuire.

 

I therefore ask that you consider taking on this role or alternatively ask that you please give some serious thought to anyone - family member, friend, work colleague - who may be suitable or willing to become part of the Group's leadership team.

 

Volunteering is a very worthwhile experience.  Meeting nights can often be busy but they are always fun.  It's a chance to gain new skills, boost your CV perhaps, meet new people and put something back into our community.

 

If you would like more information or just to have a no obligation chat please contact me.

 

Adding to the current leadership team is vital to allow the Scout Group to continue providing the excellent Scouting experience we currently do.

 

Thank you in anticipation for your support.
