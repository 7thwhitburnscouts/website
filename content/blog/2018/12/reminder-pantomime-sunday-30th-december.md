The buses for tomorrow's pantomime outing will depart Brucefield at 12 noon. We hope to arrive back at Brucefield, after the show, at approximately 4.15 pm.

All Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers are asked to wear FULL UNIFORM.

Everyone may wish to bring a snack and perhaps some money as the theatres often sell merchandise.

Any questions, please contact Gavin on 01501 773519.
