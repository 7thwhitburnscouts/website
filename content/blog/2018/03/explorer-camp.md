Â 

The Explorers visited the Craigs campsite Friday night as part of the Zodiac Challenge (6 Nights Away, in each of the seasons, each time camping with a new challenge). Given the weather the previous week, we were hopeful to complete the sub-zero challenge (camping in temperatures below 0c) but the recorded temperature remained a stubborn 1c. Very cold, but not cold enough!.

Instead the Explorer's camped in our groups Tipi Style tents, completing the "In an unusual tent" challenge.

The explorers had a good time learning core camping skills including building and starting a fire when wood is very wet, cooking on an open fire and how to work with axes and saws on a campsite.

We also had time to help a out of doors first aid training course by being "casualties".
