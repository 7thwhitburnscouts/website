Buses for the pantomime are leaving Brucefield Church at 1 pm tomorrow for the show starting at 2 pm.Â  We expect to be back at Brucefield at around 5.15 pm.

All Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorer Scouts are asked to be in full uniform - sweatshirt/shirt, necker and smart trousers.

We advise that lunch is had before gathering at Brucefield and a snack or sweets brought along if necessary.

Many thanks.
