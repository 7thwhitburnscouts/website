Sunday 14 November 2021

The annual Remembrance Day Parade and Service returns this year.

This important parade and service takes place on **Sunday 14th November 2021**. We are assembling at the car park behind Taste Café on Armadale Road **at 10.15 am** for a 10.30 departure.

After a short service at the Cenotaph we will move to the South Church for the Church service.

The parade will then return to the Masonic Hall for refreshments and a snack.  **Proceedings should finish around 1.15 pm**. If preferred, parents can collect their children at the end of the parade (**around 12.45 pm**).

This event has always been considered an ‘optional’ parade for members as it can be a very cold day and the service deals with sombre themes.  However, everyone is very much invited to attend and those that do **are asked to wear their full uniform as well as smart trousers. If possible, warm underclothes should be worn.**
