The leaflet drop to promote the Scout Post takes place this week.

**Leaflets are sorted into streets and can be collected at the start of Scout/Explorer Scout meetings on Tuesday and Cub and Beaver meetings on Thursday this week.**

Alternatively, leaflets will be available on Saturday morning from Brucefield Church Halls at 9.30 am.

We very much hope all families help out and can take a number of streets.

Any questions, please call Gavin on 01501 773519.
