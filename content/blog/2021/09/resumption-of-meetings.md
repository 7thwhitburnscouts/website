GUIDANCE FOR THE RESTART OF FACE-TO-FACE SCOUT MEETINGS

We are all really looking forward to face-to-face meetings resuming this week.   As with all Scouting activities, keeping everyone safe and well is our priority.  COVID-19 brings extra requirements and therefore things will be a little different from when we last met in March 2020.

We would be grateful if everyone could read the following arrangements and if parents of younger children could discuss these with them prior to meetings:

1. No one should attend meetings if you have any COVID-19 symptoms – continuous cough, temperature or loss of taste/smell – or generally feel unwell
2. Entry to halls will be by the front door between the two churches only.  Please do not use the car park entrance
3. Children will exit the building by the front door leading directly onto the Main Street (blue doors of the original church)
4. Everyone will be asked to sanitise hands on entering the building
5. Unless medically except, anyone over the age of 12 is required to wear a face covering indoors
6. We will try to be outdoors as much as possible – weather dependant of course
7. Initially, the Scouts will meet from 6.30 - 8 pm and the Explorer Scouts 8 - 9.30 pm, both on Tuesdays. 
8. Due to building work being carried out at Brucefield Church, the hall normally used by the Cub Scouts is not available at present.  This means that initially there will only be one Beaver Scout colony (from 5.30 – 6.30 pm) and the Cubs will then meet from 6.45 to 7.45 pm on Thursday evenings.
