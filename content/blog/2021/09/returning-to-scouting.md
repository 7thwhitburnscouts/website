**We are planning on resuming all Scout meetings in September. Section leaders have been contacting all those members prior to the pandemic to determine if they intend returning to the Scout Group.**

**We appreciate that contact details may have changed over the past 18 months, so if you haven't been contacted and plan returning to us, please call Gavin on 01501 773519 or e-mail johnston\_gavin@hotmail.com.**
