The Scouts and Explorers are due to start back on the 7th of September (this coming Tuesday).Â  We are going to have our meeting at the Craigs campsite (Broompark, Torphichen, Bathgate EH48 4NL). If the kids can wear old clothes that they don't mind getting a bit dirty potentially and their necker as well (no need for full uniform), and sturdy shoes and potentially a waterproof jacket (although the weather forecast looks quite nice). We will provide everything else, antibacterial gel and the equipment needed for the night. We will meet at the main car park around 18:30 and the evening will end at 20:30 for pickup. I appreciate that this is short notice and totally understandable if you cannot make it but would be good to see as many of you as possible
