Many thanks to everyone who has offered to help with a Scout Post delivery this year. You should have been informed of your day.

There are still many people who haven't returned a form and we really need more help. Every member benefits from the money raised and that's why we're keen everyone does their utmost to help.

**Deliveries are:**

**Sunday 12th December @ 12.30 pm and**

**Saturday 18th December @ 9.30 am.**

Cards are all sorted for delivery and we do our best to give people a known area or an area we know that is easy to deliver to.

IF YOU HAVEN'T, PLEASE RETURN A FORM THIS WEEK, E-MAIL ME AT JOHNSTON\_GAVIN@HOTMAIL.COM OR CALL 01501 773519 WITH A SUITABLE DATE.

Thank you!
