First, it has been BRILLIANT being back! In particular, seeing so many of our young people returning after nearly a year and a half away has been terrific.

**Please note that there will be no meetings next week - Tuesday 12th or Thursday 14th October - due to the October school holidays. We return week beginning the 18th.**

Have a good holiday please and take care.
