Any Beaver Scout wishing to attend Saturday's trip to Wonder World in Falkirk needs to hand in their consent form tomorrow please.

The bus is leaving Brucefield Church at 9.30 am on Saturday morning and we intend returning to Brucefield at around 12.30 pm.

There is no cost to parents for this trip as it will be paid for through Group funds. All Beaver should wear their sweatshirt and necker for travelling purposes. Drinks will be provided.

Wonder World has Go-Karts costing Â£1 to drive. Anyone wishing to use these should bring some money.
