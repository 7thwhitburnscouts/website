Happy New Year to All!

Scout and Explorer Scout meetings started back on Tuesday and so do Beaver and Cub Scouts tonight.

We currently have spaces for new people within our Scout Troop (Tuesdays, 6.30 - 8.30 pm for young people aged 10 - 14 years old), the Explorer Scouts (Tuesdays, 7.30 - 9.30 pm for young people aged 14 - 18 years old) and within our second Beaver Colony (Thursdays, 6.45 - 7.45 pm for young people aged 6 - 8 years old).

We currently have a waiting list operating for our Cub Scout Pack (Thursdays, 6.15 - 7.45 pm for young people aged 8 - 10 years old) and our first Beaver Colony (Thursdays, 5.30 - 6.30 pm for young people aged 6 - 8 years old). Please get in touch through the website, our Facebook page or by contacting Gavin on 01501 773519 if you'd like placed on the waiting list.

All our Sections deliver the Scout Association's dynamic and fun programme providing young people with the chance to develop a wide range of crucial life skills through fun activities and experiences.
