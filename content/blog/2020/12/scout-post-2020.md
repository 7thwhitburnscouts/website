We are very sorry to announce that due to Government and Scout Association COVID restrictions, we are unable to operate our annual Christmas Post service this year.  We know that the Scout Post is a much relied upon service for many in the community and has been since it began in 1985.  We apologise for this but hope people will appreciate that this decision has been made due to factors outwith our control.  

The Post is also our principal fundraiser of the year and the money raised - approx £2500 in 2019 - would be spent on the membership fees to the Scout Association for all our young members. This allows us to reduce the cost of Scouting to our members and help make Scouting, as it should be, available to all.
