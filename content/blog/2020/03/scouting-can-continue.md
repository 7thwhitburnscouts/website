Hello everyone

We hope everyone is well.

Scout meetings and events may be suspended at the moment but that doesn't mean Scouting has to stop altogether!

We've added a new section to our website - Self-Scouting! The plan is to post information on activities and badges that all our young members can work on until meetings resume.

Keep "evidence" for the badges and bring it along when we return. You could even post pictures, comments, advice on our Facebook page or e-mail it to info@7thwhitburnscouts.org.uk and we will get it on the website.

Keep safe everyone please, look after everyone and keep Scouting!
