First, we hope that everyone is safe and well 😊  

We are hoping to try a weekly online Beaver meeting through Zoom. Planned starting date on Thursday 30th April at 6pm for approximately 30-40 mins.   

Each meeting would require a parent to be online with their child to help with activities, but also for child protection reasons.   

Each meeting would include an art activity, a (silly!) game and a wee challenge to practise for the following week. We would let you know in advance what you would require ie paper, colouring pens and scissors. We promise to keep things simple for you all 😊  

If you would be interested in your child joining in can you please “like” the Facebook post to help us judge numbers.   

I will post again later with more information and a time for a “trial” Zoom meeting on Thursday, to make sure everyone is comfortable with the platform.   

Take care 😊

Elaine
