2017's Scout Post finished yesterday with the last delivery going out on Saturday morning.  We delivered 11,022 cards and raised £2182.27 this year.  This compares with 12,142 cards and £2348.13 in 2016.  Not too bad all in all!

Many thanks to everyone who helped in any way.

The money raised goes towards the funding of the Group for the year ahead.

Have a very Merry Christmas and best wishes for the New Year!
