If you haven't been able to help this year so far, would like to help again or are looking for the perfect excuse to avoid the shops tomorrow then the final Scout Post delivery goes out tomorrow.

The fun starts from 9.30 am at Brucefield Church Halls.Â  If you can help, please come along.

Many thanks.
