It's looking like the weather is once again going to thwart a visit to Polkemmet.

 

Should there be a sudden change or the weather forecasters are wrong then the plan is for the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - to be dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm.  We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area – close to the park’s Visitor Centre.  Parents may of course wish to consider sharing transport if convenient or if transport is an issue, please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

 

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on the weather.  Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.

 

**If the weather is, as expected, poor then we will revert back to a normal Thursday night programme with the same meeting times at Brucefield Church Halls.  Updates will be posted on the Group website and Facebook page and if in doubt please contact one of the Section Leaders.**
