Unsurprisingly, if you've been or looked outside today, we are going to have to cancel our planned evening at Polkemmet Country Park tonight.    Please don't go to Polkemmet.

 

It's rained most of the day, is still raining and the forecast is for more rain sadly!

 

As mentioned in an earlier post, with the church halls being used for the General Election today we have no alternative meeting place.

 

Cancelling any of our meetings really is a last resort.  We're sorry to disappoint everyone.  But, we'll be back to normal meetings at Brucefield next Thursday.  Keep dry in the meantime please!
