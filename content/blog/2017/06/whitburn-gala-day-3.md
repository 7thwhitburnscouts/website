Many thanks to everyone who came along on Saturday and took part in the Gala Day procession.  And thank you to parents and guardians who encouraged and perhaps cajoled their child(ren) to be there.

 

We had a great turnout and many people of the town commented on it which is just brilliant.

 

THANK YOU!
