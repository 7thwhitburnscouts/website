We will be gathering in **Brucefield Church Car Park** at **10.15 am** and everyone can be collected from the top end of **King George V Park** (Park View/Bog Road end) at approximately **12 noon** – look out for the Group’s flags.

 

We ask that full uniform - Scout shirt or jumper, necker and smart trousers and shoes - be worn and please note that we will provide ponchos in the event of poor weather and juice too.

 

Whilst appreciating that some Beaver and Cub Scouts in particular may be walking with their school or other youth organisations on the Gala Day we would very much like to see as many people walking with the Group as possible.

 

Attendance at Sunday's Civic Week Parade and Service wasn't very good sadly so an improved turnout at the Gala Day would be great.

 

**PLEASE DON'T WAVE _AT_ US - COME AND WAVE _WITH_ US!**
