Once again the Church Halls are being used for voting - this time the General Election on Thursday 8 June 2017.  We are therefore heading back to Polkemmet Country Park - weather dependent!

 

We ask that the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - are dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm.  We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area – close to the park’s Visitor Centre.  Parents may of course wish to consider sharing transport if convenient.

 

If transport is an issue please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

 

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on the weather.  Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.

 

As with other outings to Polkemmet, if the weather is poor then sadly the evening will have to be cancelled as no alternative accommodation is available to us.   **Please do not go to Polkemmet if the weather is not suitable for being outdoors**.  Please use your own judgement and if in doubt, contact me on 743288 AFTER 4.30 PM ON THE THURSDAY EVENING.

 

We will also post updates on the website and Facebook page on Thursday afternoon.
