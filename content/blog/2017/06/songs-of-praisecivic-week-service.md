The annual Songs of Praise/Civic Week Service takes place tomorrow (Sunday 18 June) as part of Whitburn Civic Week events.

 

We are gathering in Whitburn Bowling Club car park at 2.15 pm for the parade leaving at 2.30 pm.  We walk to Whitburn Academy for the service and should be back at the Bowling Club for around 4.15 pm.

 

We ask that full uniform - Scout shirt or jumper, necker and smart trousers and shoes - be worn.

 

As a Group, improving parade attendance remains one of our ongoing aims.  We would very much like to see as many members attending as possible.
