Many thanks to everyone who helped deliver Scout Post promotional leaflets over the the weekend.

 

We still have quite a few to go out so if you feel you could or would like to assist further then the leaflets will be available for uplift tonight at the Scouts and Explorer Scouts and once again on Thursday evening for any Beaver and Cub Scout parents to pick up.

 

Many thanks for any help you can give - it would be greatly appreciated.
