Many thanks to everyone - children and leaders alike - who came along to yesterday's Remembrance Day Parade and Service.

The number of people taking part in the parade and present at the War Memorial seems to increase each year and it was terrific that the Scout Group was there and well represented.Â  Especially on such a particularly cold, if dry, day.

Thank you very much.
