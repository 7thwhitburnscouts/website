The promotional leaflets will be available for uplift tonight for any Scout and Explorer Scout parents who can't make the delivery on Saturday.  The same will be happening on Thursday for Beaver parents.  The Cubs may be visiting Bathgate Fire Station but feel free to pop in to Brucefield tonight or on Thursday to pick up some leaflets.

Please take a few streets - it lightens the load for everyone else!

Thank you very much!
