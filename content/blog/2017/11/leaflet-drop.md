Many thanks to everyone who picked up Scout Post promotional leaflets on Tuesday or last night.  Lots are gone, but we still have a lots left to be delivered.

If haven't taken any - or you'd like some more! - please come along tomorrow morning at 9.30 am.  The main (big, blue) door on the Main Street will be open.  Even if you can't delivery tomorrow morning, please come and take some away and deliver at a time convenient to you.

Many hands...

Thank you very much!
