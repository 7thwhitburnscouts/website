# 12th - 14th May 2017 Parent & Cub Camp

An opportunity for Cubs to share the fun of Scouting with a parent. Fully catered weekend, guaranteed to be fun for all!

The activities throughout the weekend reflect the nature of the countryside in which the Centre is located. Nature walks, archery and crafts are just some of the usual activities for Meggernie. The weather will have an influence on what is actually possible at the time but it will all be great fun. There will be two sub camps with sub camp leaders to help make your stay enjoyable. The weekend is fully catered so you just need your own kit and a two-man tent for the two of you to sleep in.

The cost of the weekend will be Â£85 per pair. Places are limited (max.6 pairs of cubs and parents per pack) and will be allocated on a first come basis. Please note that each adult attending this camp must have had an enhanced disclosure for the Scout Association.

Visit the [Meggernie](http://www.meggernie.org/Cubs.html) website for more information, or discuss with one of the leaders.
