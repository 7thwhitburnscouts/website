Thank you very much to everyone who came along on Friday to our annual ceilidh at Whitburn Bowling Club.

The dance floor was never empty, the buffet was pretty much cleared and the fantastic sum of £406 was raised for Group funds.

Thanks also to everyone who sold tickets, donated raffle prizes and to Balfour Beatty for donating the £100 voucher to be spent at any McDonald's hotel.  And a special thank you to Louise and Neil Brodie for pulling it all together.  A terrific job - well done!
