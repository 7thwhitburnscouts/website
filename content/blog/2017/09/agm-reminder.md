Just a wee reminder of the AGM taking place tomorrow night at 8 pm in Brucefield Church Halls.

 

We anticipate the meeting - consisting of the election of Office Bearers, Section reports, presentation of accounts and GSL report - to last no longer the 30 minutes.

 

I very much hope you can come along and show your support for the Scout Group.
