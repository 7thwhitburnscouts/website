Please can we remind any Cub Scouts wishing to attend the Group Camp at Fordell Firs, near Inverkeithing, over the weekend of the 15 - 17th September that consent forms should be returned tonight.

 

The deadline for Beaver Scouts to return consent forms to take part in the Saturday visit to Fordell is next Thursday - the 14th September.  We've booked Fordell's excellent play area so get those forms in!

 

Going out tonight will also be a wee letter giving the rescheduled AGM arrangements.  It's taking place on Thursday 21st September at 8 pm and will last no longer than 30 minutes.  Office Bearers will be elected, section reports given and Group's accounts presented.  Come along and support us if you can.

 

Also going out tonight will be the be little promotional postcards.  As the accompanying letter says, if you know someone aged for the Beavers or the Cubs, please pass on the postcard to them.  If you know a youngster who might enjoy the Beavers or Cubs, please tell them about us!  If your son or daughter has a friend - or friends - please ask them to come along!
