Please can we have all consent forms from Scouts and Explorer Scouts returned tonight for those wishing to attend the Group Camp over the weekend of the 15 - 17th September at Fordell Firs near Inverkeithing.

 

We'll be under canvas and have lots of Fordell on-site activities booked including Jacob’s Ladder, Bungee, archery, go-karts, grass sledging and assault course.

 

**NB:  Cub Scouts are asked to return their forms on Thursday please.**
