The Group's AGM had to be postponed in May due to a family bereavement that delayed the production of our accounts.

 

It will now take place on Thursday 21st September at 8 pm in the McMartin Hall (where the Cubs and Scouts meet), Brucefield Church Halls.

 

We anticipate the meeting - consisting of the election of Office Bearers, Section reports, presentation of accounts and GSL report - to last no longer the 30 minutes.

 

Please come along and show your support for the Scout Group.
