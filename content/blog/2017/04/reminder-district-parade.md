The West Lothian District Parade takes place tomorrow - 23 April 2017.

The bus is leaving Brucefield at 1.30 pm and we expect to be home around 4.30 pm.

Everyone is asked to make a real effort to attend!Â  Please wear full uniform, including school trousers and shoes.

Look forward to seeing as many there as possible!

(For parents thinking about coming along, the parade leaves from Lowport Primary School around 2.30 pm, along the Main Street to St Michael's church beside Linlithgow Palace.)
