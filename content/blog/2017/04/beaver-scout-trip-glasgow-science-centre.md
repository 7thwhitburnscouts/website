We are planning to take the Beaver Scouts to Glasgow Science Centre, on Saturday 27th May 2017.  This outing will be paid for with money raised by the Scout Post and therefore free of charge to parents/guardians.

 

The bus will depart from Brucefield Church at 9 am on the Saturday morning and we intend returning to Whitburn at approximately 4 pm - traffic dependent.

 

For insurance purposes, the Beavers are required to wear their normal Thursday night uniform – ie sweatshirt and necker.  The kids should also bring with them a packed lunch - preferably in a rucksack/school bag.

 

There is of course the obligatory gift shop at Science Centre that the Beavers may wish to visit.

 

Letters and consent forms will go out this week.  Please can they be completed and returned by Thursday 25 May 2017.
