The church halls are being used for the Local Council Elections on Thursday 4 May 2017.  Therefore,  we are once again planning to take both the Cub and Beaver Scouts to Polkemmet Country Park on that evening.

 

We ask that the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - are dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm.  We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area – close to the park’s Visitor Centre.

 

If transport is an issue please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

 

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on the weather.  Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.

 

As with other outings to Polkemmet, if the weather is poor then sadly the evening will have to be cancelled as no alternative accommodation is available to us.  We will post any updates on our website and Facebook page next week.
