Many thanks to everyone who came along to the parade yesterday.  Everyone looked very smart, the sun shone and the service was good.

We could have perhaps had a few more bodies in attendance and we look forward to seeing more people coming along to the forthcoming parades in Whitburn over May and June.

Many thanks!
