Hopefully everyone had a great October week - whatever you were up to.

Scout and Explorer Scout meetings resume tonight - Tuesday 24 October.  Scouts (10 - 14 year olds) meetings are from 6.30 - 8.30 pm and Explorer (14 - 18 year olds) meetings are from 7.30 - 9.30 pm.

Beaver and Cub Scout meetings start back on Thursday.  Beavers ( 6 - 8 year olds) have two sessions - 5.30 - 6.30 pm and 6.45 - 7.45 pm - and Cub meetings (for 8 - 10 year olds) are from 6.15 - 7.45 pm.

New - and old! - faces are always welcome.

Also, letters went out before the holiday for the pantomime in January and the Scout Post asking for everyone to get involved with one delivery.  Please return forms as soon as possible.  Many thanks.
