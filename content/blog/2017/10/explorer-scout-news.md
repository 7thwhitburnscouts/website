Our Assistant Cub Scout Leader, Paul Freeman, will be changing roles within the Group to become the Explorer Scout Leader with immediate effect.  Paul will bring to the Explorers his huge experience and commitment to Scouting and will be a real asset to the Explorer Section.

Neil Brodie will be returning his focus to the Beaver Scouts but is greatly thanked for taking on the role of Explorer Scout Leader in June 2015 and for all his hard work, effort and input to the Section during this time.

Paul won't be disappearing from the Cubs straight away and will be assisting with both Sections to help with transitional arrangements.
