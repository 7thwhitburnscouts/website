The Brucefield Church Parade and Service takes place this weekend.  We are gathering at 10.15 am on Sunday in the Bowling Club's car park.  From there we walk to Brucefield Church for the service and walk back to the Bowling Club arriving around 12.15 pm.

 

We ask that parents make a real effort to have their child there.  Please look smart - full uniform, school trousers and shoes would be brilliant!

 

We appreciate that parades may perhaps not be as exciting as a camp or outing to Polkemmet or the Science Centre but they are part of being part of the Scout Group.  Please do your best to attend.  Many thanks in anticipation.

 

Any issues, please get in touch.
