Please note that the AGM due to take place on Sunday 7th May is, unfortunately, having to be postponed.  A family bereavement has delayed the production of our accounts.  The Council Elections requiring us to take the Beavers and Cubs to Polkemmet Country Park on Thursday 4th May also meant we thought it would be too soon to head back to Polkemmet for a Sausage Sizzle as part of the AGM.

We will of course let you know the new date of the AGM as soon as we can.  Many thanks.
