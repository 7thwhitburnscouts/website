The Cub Scouts are camping at Torphichen and the Beavers are off to the Glasgow Science Centre this morning.

 

Bus is leaving at 9 am.  Uniform, packed lunch and some money should you wish to visit the gift shop is all that's needed.   They're due back at Brucefield at 4 pm - M8 traffic dependent.

 

Have a great weekend everyone - long may the sun shine!
