Bag packing at B & M’s in Bathgate has been booked over the weekend of the 12th and 13th August 2017.

 

We're very much hoping that kids from each section - accompanied by their parent/guardian - will come along and help.

 

Each Group Section has been allocated half a day with this split in to two slots as shown below:

 

<table width="501"><tbody><tr><td width="106">Sat 12 August</td><td width="71">Beavers</td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 10 – 11.30 am</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 11.30 am – 1 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106">Sat 12 August</td><td width="71">Explorers</td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 1 – 2.30 pm</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 2.30 – 4 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106">Sun 13 August</td><td width="71">Cubs</td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 10 – 11.30 am</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 11.30 am – 1 pm</td></tr><tr><td width="106">Sun 13 August</td><td width="71">Scouts</td><td width="151">Slot 1 = 1 – 2.30 pm</td><td width="173">Slot 2 = 2.30 – 4 pm</td></tr></tbody></table>

 

Please come along and help.  The more that do, the more tills can be covered, the more money raised.  All the money goes towards paying for outings, camps and the general running of the Group.   Such fundraising reduces the need to ask parents to pay for activities or how much money activities cost members.

 

If you are able to help then I would be grateful if you could contact Louise on 01501 773519, e-mail [louise.burton21@googlemail.com](mailto:louise.burton21@googlemail.com) or leave a message on the Group’s Facebook page.  We will contact you back with your allocated time.

 

THANK YOU!
