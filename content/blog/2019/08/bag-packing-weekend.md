Just a reminder that we have bag packing booked at B&Ms in Bathgate, next weekend, Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th August.

We'd appreciate a bigger turn out this year from the kids, and parents, if possible to show the public who actually benefit from the money collected.

Thank you to those parents who have already signed up their child and/or themselves! Each section has a time slot so please have a look below and contact me on 01501 773519 or via the Group's Facebook page if you can help out at any of them. If you can't make your child's section time then please come along to another time slot.

  
**Saturday**

Scouts: 10 - 11.30 am or 11.30 - 1 pm

Explorers: 1.00 - 2.30 pm or 2.30 - 4 pm

  
**Sunday**

Cubs: 10 - 11.30 am or 11.30 - 1 pm
