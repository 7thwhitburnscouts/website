Many thanks to the leaders, parents and all our young people who have already volunteered to come along to the fundraising bag packing over the weekend at B & M's, Bathgate.

We still need more people to help, particularly on the Saturday but also Sunday morning.

The times are as follows:

**Saturday**

Scouts: 10 – 11.30 am or 11.30 – 1 pm

Explorers: 1.00 – 2.30 pm or 2.30 – 4 pm

  
**Sunday**

Cubs: 10 – 11.30 am or 11.30 – 1 pm

Beavers: 1.00 – 2.30 pm or 2.30 – 4 pm

It's not crucial people come along to their Section slot; whenever you can help, your help would be appreciated.

If you can help, please come along or contact Louise on 01501 773519 or at louise.burton21@googlemail.com.
