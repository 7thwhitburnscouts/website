You have perhaps noticed - and hopefully received - a number of letters over recent weeks concerning the upcoming annual Scout Post - the Group's main fundraising event of the year.

1. SCOUT POST ROTA - Please can we ask that if a Scout Post rota return - the delivery date you can help with - hasn't been returned, that it is on Tuesday and Thursday this week. The rota needs to be put together and people who have already offered to help informed of the day they are required. **We ask that all families help with one delivery since all members benefit greatly from the money raised by the Scout Post. Thank you.**

3. MEETING FOR PARENTS NEW TO SCOUT POST - a brief meeting will be held on Thursday, 21 November 2019 at 6.15 pm and lasting only 15 minutes. It is being held in the McKnight Lounge, Brucefield Church Halls. It is a chance to hear how the Post works and to have any questions or concerns you may have answered.
4. SCOUT POST PROMOTIONAL LEAFLET - is taking place this Saturday, 23 November 2019 from 9.30 am. We are looking for help delivering leaflets throughout the town promoting the service. For anyone unable to help on Saturday, leaflets will be available to uplift after the Scouts/Explorers on Tuesday and the Beavers/Cub Scouts on Thursday. Any help would be much appreciated.
