Many thanks to everyone who helped delivery the promotional leaflets over the weekend. A tremendous number went out which is brilliant. There are a few pockets of the town still to do and if anyone is able and willing then please speak to any of the leaders.

Thank you also to everyone who has returned a Rota form indicating when they can help with a Scout Post delivery. Little green slips advising you of your date will go out on Tuesday and Thursday. If a form hasn't been returned, there's still plenty of time to help! Please return a form ASAP, call 01501 773519 or e-mail johnston\_gavin@hotmail.com.
