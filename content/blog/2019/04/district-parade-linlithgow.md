Many thanks to those who came along (and to parents for cajoling and helping their child be there!) to the annual District Parade on Sunday, 28th April, in Linlithgow.

Attendance was below expectations, but those who did attend represented the Scout Group terrifically well.

Letters go out this week for our next parade, the Brucefield Church Parade and Service which is taking place on Sunday 12th May. We would love if more people could make the effort to attend this parade where possible.
