Due to the halls being used for the European Elections on Thursday (23 May 2019), Beaver and Cub Scouts will be going to Polkemmet Country Park for the evening.

We ask that the Cubs and Beavers - from BOTH Beavers groups - are dropped off at Polkemmet at 6 pm and collected once again at 7.30 pm.  We intend gathering at and departing from the car park nearest to the adventure play area – close to the park’s Visitor Centre.  Parents may of course wish to consider sharing transport if convenient.

Everyone is asked to wear their normal Thursday night uniform but wear sensible outdoor footwear and a jacket may be useful depending on the weather.  Drinks and a snack will be provided during the evening.

If transport is an issue please contact one of the leaders and arrangements will be made to get any kids to and from Polkemmet.

**As with other outings to Polkemmet, if the weather is poor then sadly the evening will have to be cancelled as no alternative accommodation is available to us.   Please do not go to Polkemmet if the weather is not suitable for being outdoors.  Please use your own judgement and if in doubt, contact Gavin on 743288 AFTER 4.30 PM ON THE THURSDAY EVENING.  We will also post any information on our website and Facebook page.**
