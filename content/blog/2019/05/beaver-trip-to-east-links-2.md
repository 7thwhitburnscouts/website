The Beaver Scouts are going to East Links Family Park, near Dunbar on Saturday - 1 June 2019.

The bus is leaving Brucefield Church at 9 am and we intend returning at approximately 5 pm.

Beavers are asked to wear their uniform, bring a jacket and a packed lunch. There is a gift shop that the children may wish to visit.

Anyone wishing to go who has not already returned a consent form, please do so on Thursday. If a consent form is needed or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to speak to any leader on Thursday.
