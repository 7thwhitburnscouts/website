We look forward to welcoming back all our Scouts and Explorer Scouts tonight for a new year of fun and exciting Scouting.

New faces are always welcome! Scouts are for young people aged between 10 - 14 years old and meet on Tuesdays between 6.30 and 8.30 pm. Explorer Scouts are for young people aged between 14 - 18 years old and meet also on a Tuesday from 7.30 - 8.30 pm. All meetings take place at Brucefield Church, East Main Street, Whitburn.

Simply come along to any meeting, visit our website at [www.7thwhitburnscouts.org.uk](http://www.7thwhitburnscouts.org.uk/) or contact Gavin Johnston on 01501 773519.

The Scout Troop enters a new chapter this year as Zack Renwick takes up the reins of the Scout Troop from Graeme Brown. Both Graeme and Zack will work together over the next few months as the transition takes place. We wish Zack, George, Peter and the entire Scout Troop the best of luck over the year ahead. Graeme has no intention of disappearing and will still be very much part of the Group.
