Our annual fundraising Scout Post ended on the 22nd December with the final delivery taking place.

9392 cards were delivered and £1968 raised this year.  This compares with 11,022 cards delivered and £2182.27 raised in 2017.    The money raised helps to pay for each members capitation fee to the Scout Association and the general running of the Scout Group.

We would like to thank those who used the service to send cards, everyone who helped with collecting, sorting and delivering the cards and especially all the shops who accept cards and support the Post.
