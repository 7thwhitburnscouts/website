Thank you very much to everyone who has helped out with a delivery this year. The weather has not been particularly kind so everyone's attendance and efforts so far are very much appreciated.

Saturday is the final delivery and the weather forecast is looking better. If you have helped with a delivery, you've done your bit - thank you. If you haven't, please come along to Brucefield Church at 9.30 am on Saturday. If anyone wishes to help again then you certainly wouldn't be turned away!
