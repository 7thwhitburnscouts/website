All Scout Group meetings have now finished for the year.

Scout and Explorer Scout meetings will resume on Tuesday 7th January 2020 and Beaver and Cub Scout meetings on Thursday 9th January 2020.

We would like to wish everyone a very Happy Christmas and best wishes for 2020.

Although of course we'll see many of you on the 30th December for the pantomime outing! We'll post a reminder nearer the time.
