2019's Christmas Post is complete! 8137 cards were delivered this year raising the over Â£2300 for Group Funds.

Thank you so much to all families who helped with delivering cards. We had a few rather wet and wild deliveries this year, but it didn't deter us.

We would also like to thank those shops who collect cards from the public. Their support is invaluable and hugely appreciated.
