Due to Brucefield Church being used for the General Election tomorrow, Thursday 12 December 2019, the Beaver and Cub Scouts will be going to Bathgate Cinema to see a private showing of The Addams Family.

The bus will depart Brucefield Church at 5.30 pm and we intend being back at the Church for approximately 8.10 pm. The cost is £5. The Group will be subsiding the cost of the cinema ticket and is paying for the bus.

Anyone not yet returned a form can still join us. Please just come along with a consent form and £5 tomorrow night. We'll have some spare forms incase anyone needs one.

**PLEASE NOTE: There will be no Beaver or Cub meetings at Brucefield for those not wishing to go the cinema.**
