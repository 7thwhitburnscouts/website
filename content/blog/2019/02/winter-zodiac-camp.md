Congratulations to Explorers, Lewis and Cameron for successfully completing the Zodiac Bronze Award this weekend. Well done also to Alex for his first camp.

The Zodiac award involves camping in each of the four seasons; Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter whilst completing a challenge. The challenge at this camp was a tough one, sleeping at least 6 foot off the ground. The Explorers chose to sleep in a tree house in the Adventure playground at the Craigs. The problem was that the tree house has no roof and the walls have plenty of gaps to let in the wind. With extensive use of rope and tarpaulin, the Explorers were able to built and shelter and survived a very windy and cold night.
