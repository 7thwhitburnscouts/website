Due to a serious power outage at Bonaly Scout Centre, Edinburgh, the Group Camp this weekend will now be taking place at The Craig Camping and Training Centre, Torphichen.

**OTHER THAN THE CHANGE OF VENUE, ALL OTHER ARRANGEMENTS REMAIN THE SAME.**

We were very much looking forward to going to Bonaly and had an exciting programme planned for the weekend. Due to the extremely late change to the venue, we will now have to make a number of changes to the activities we do and apologise for this. However, we feel it is better that we go ahead rather than cancel the camp. Â 

Cubs, Scouts and Explorers should be at Brucefield for the bus leaving at 6 pm tonight and will return again at 4 pm on Sunday afternoon.

The bus for the Beavers will leave on Saturday morning, 14th September at 11 am and return again at 4 pm.
