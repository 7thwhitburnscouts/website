Last week letters went out promoting our annual bag packing fund raising event at B & M's in Bathgate over the weekend of 10th and 11th August.

We are just asking that parents and their child come along for a small part of each Section's designated half day.

Please get in touch with Louise on 01501 773519 or at [louise.burton21@googlemail.com](mailto:louise.burton21@googlemail.com) with when you can help.

The money raised during this event helps us reduce the amount we need to request from parents. _Please get involved._

Letters and consent forms also went out to Cubs, Scouts and Explorers regarding the Group Camp in September. Please return these as soon as possible.

We've asked that these be returned for the first week in September.

If anyone missed these items, please speak to any leader.
