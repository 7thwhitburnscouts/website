Tomorrow is Whitburn's big day! It is also a day to show Whitburn how big Scouting is in the town. A fantastic number of Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers come along to weekly meetings, outings and camps. We need them to come along to tomorrow's Gala Day too!

We are meeting at Brucefield Church Car Park - behind the church - at 10.15 am. We will head down to Whitburn Academy around 10.30 am to form up for the procession. Everyone is asked to wear full uniform, including smart trousers and shoes. The weather forecast is looking good so the already-purchased ponchos won't hopefully be needed. Juice and some sweets will be provided and everyone will get a chance to carry the flags. It is the Gala Day after all!

The children can be collected at the top end of King George V Park - Park View/Bog Road end - around 12 noon.

_Please don't wave at us - come along and wave with us!_
