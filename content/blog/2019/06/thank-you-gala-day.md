Many thanks to everyone who came along to the Gala Day on Saturday. Turnout, particularly from the Beavers, was terrific. Thank you to parents for bringing our young people along and possibly cajoling where necessary!

The flags are now away until their next outing for Remembrance Sunday in November.
