The parade and service to mark the start of Whitburn's Civic Week takes place tomorrow, Sunday 16th June.

We are meeting at Whitburn Bowling Club at 2.15 pm for the parade leaving at 2.30 pm. We intend returning to the Bowling Club at around 4.15 pm.

All Beavers, Cub Scouts, Scouts and Explorers are asked to wear full uniform, including smart trousers and shoes. A collection for charity will be taken during the service.

Parade attendance has been disappointing this year so far. We would love to see as many of our young people attend the Songs of Praise Parade and Service as possible to show Whitburn just how strong Scouting is in the town.
