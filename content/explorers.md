Explorer Scouts are part of the worldwide Scout Movement.  This Movement began in 1907 as a small party attending a week long camp and has grown into an organisation today of over 28 million people in 216 countries.

Explorer Scouts are pretty new.  During the late 1990s, in order to meet the changing needs of new generations, two new Sections were created:  Explorer Scouts for 14 to 18-year-olds and the Scout Network for 18 to 25-year-olds.

 Explorer Scouts belong to the fourth Section in a Scout Group.  A Scout Group is usually made up of the following Sections:

[table]
Section,Age group
Beaver Scouts,6 – 8
Cub Scouts,8 – 10½
Scouts,10½ - 14
Explorer Scouts,14 – 18
Network Scouts,18 - 25
[/table]

There is some flexibility in the age ranges to allow us to best meet the needs of our members, parents and the Scout Group.

Each Section normally has a Leader, Assistant Leader(s) and perhaps Helpers.  The Scout Group as a whole is led by a Group Scout Leader (GSL).

We meet at Brucefield Church Halls, East Main Street, Whitburn on Tuesday evenings between 7.30 pm – 9.30 pm.

Holidays tend to run in-line with schools.

Subscriptions presently stand at £60 per annum.  This is paid in three installments during the year.

A major source of finance for the Scout Group comes from its annual Christmas Post service.  Money raised pays for each child’s membership fee to the Scout Association, a free camp/or outing, transport to many events and the general running of the Group.  Because every child benefits greatly from the money raised by the Scout Post, we ask every family participates in the Scout Post.

The Scout Association consists of a dark beige shirt and a Group neckerchief and woggle.  A range of other optional items is also available.  All items are available through Scout Shops Ltd outlets.  Please speak to one of the Leaders for assistance with uniforms.

Explorer Scout membership is open to any male or female aged between 14 and 18 years old who can make the Scout Promise and Law.

The Scout Promise is:

On My Honour, I promise that I will do my best
To do my duty to God and to the Queen,
To help other people
And to keep the Scout Law

The Scout Law is:

A Scout is to be trusted.
A Scout is loyal.
A Scout is friendly and considerate.
A Scout belongs to the worldwide family of Scouts.
A Scout has courage in all difficulties.
A Scout makes good use of time and is careful of possessions and property.
A Scout has self-respect and respect for others.

Scout Motto:

Be Prepared



Most Importantly - What do Explorer Scouts do?

Explorer Scouts are encouraged to take part in a wide range of activities as part of their programme including traditional Scouting skills, such as camping, survival and cooking, as well as a wider spectrum of adventurous activities, from abseiling to zorbing.

With the support, direction and guidance of Unit leaders, Explorer Scouts are encouraged to lead themselves, design their own programme and work towards the top awards that Scouting offers. With exciting prospects like being a part of camps and expeditions both home and abroad; adventurous activities such as mountaineering, parascending and off shore sailing; Explorers offers fun and adventure for all. Explorers also have the opportunity to be a part of The Young Leaders’ Scheme which develops their leadership skills and sense of responsibility, by helping to run meetings for younger sections.

Further information about Explorer Scout badges and awards can be found here.


Explorer Scouts may wear a beige shirt or blouse with a Unit scarf (or a Group one if there is a partnership agreement), and navy blue activity trousers or skirt with a Scout belt. They can wear an Explorer Belt and buckle or Young Leader Buckle if either of these has been awarded.







An equally important part of being an Explorer Scout is attending four parades during the year with the other Sections of the Scout Group. Perhaps the most important of these being Whitburn Gala day but we also walk in the District Church Parade in Linlithgow along with Scouts from all over West Lothian.
